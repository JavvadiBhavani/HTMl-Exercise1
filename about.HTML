<p>The concept of education is misunderstood my many students. Students want to study in order to make money and become rich so that they can fulfill their wants. Similarly money is invested by parents in terms of the amount of investment it will reap in the future. Because of this reason females are not given much higher education in our country. Teachers nowadays also opt colleges and schools where they do not have to give daily lectures and can make double earning by college salaries and personal home tuitions.</p>
